# Configurations for AutoHotkey

Requires: AutoHotkey v2

## Scripts

### cycle_through_apps_windows.ahk

- Cycles through open windows of the same app, like in macOS, but it shows the preview of the window.
- Modifications:
  - When there's only 1 window of the app, still show the preview of the window (instead of not showing)
